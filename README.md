Step 1 :
  write the helpers functions to calculate Z , A , cost , forward propogation as well as backward propogation
  
Step 2 :
  get online free dataset available 
  Load the data into program in form of numpy array.
  
Step 3 :
  modify the values of parameters according to type of data 
  amd update parameters depending on the accuracy.
  
  
 Conclusions :
